    <h1>Mothers Out Front 1: Viewing People Power, DS 4200 S20</h1>

    <p><strong>Rachel Waddell</strong>, <strong>Nanxi Gu</strong>, <strong>Maris McGuinness</strong>, <strong>Samyak Jain</strong></p>

    <p>Service-Learning Course Project as part of <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1781714">DS 4200: Information Presentation and Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~dcashm01/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://visualization.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Data Visualization @ Khoury</a>, <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>.</p>


    <h1>Motivation</h1>

    <p><em>Currently, Mothers out Front, a nonprofit that enables people – with a focus on mothers – to pursue 
      environmental justice is looking to improve their weekly newsletters to their base. They want to include visualization
      that allows people to see the current size of the movement in an engaging way, including the three steps of their 
      "Ladder of Engagement:" Supporting (base who have not volunteered yet), Taking Action (volunteers), and Leading 
      (people who take charge and organize). A secondary goal is to allow users to personalize the visualization by zooming 
      in on their home state and even city, if a team exists there. To fulfill these needs, we have created a bar chart to show 
      overall movement size stratified accross the three levels of involvement linked to a chloropleth map that allows zooming-in on 
      states, which then filters the bar chart to the state data.
    </em></p>


    <h1>Visualization</h1>
    <p>
      Below are the numbers of people at each level of the Ladder of Engagement. <b>Hover to see exact numbers!</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Explore the map to find your local team and see your state's specifics represented in the people power chart! <br/>
      <b>NOTE:</b> If your state is gray and the bar chart is empty when you zoom in, there is not a team in your area, yet.
      Visit the <a href="http://mothersoutfront.org" target="_blank">Mothers Out Front website</a> to see about changing that!

    <h1>Demo Video</h1>

    <p><em>Embedded MP4 demo video using the HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag. For example, this screen recording Prof. Cody Dunne made of Mike Bostock's flexible transitions in D3 slide:</em></p>

    <video controls width="100%">

      <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is
       a <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/shared/d3-flexible-transitions.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
    </video>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

    <p><em>Final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation slides.</em></p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Data sources match the problem statement and are appropriate. These descriptions should be very explicit so someone could read your page and properly reproduce your results.</em></p>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p><em>Summary of task table.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Clearly describes domain tasks, processes, goals and abstract tasks for domain problems.</em></p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>

    <p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement.
    Logical discussion of design choices grounded in theory from course.
    Discusses feedback from usability testing.</em></p>


    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p><em>Short summary of work completed and areas for improvement/future-work.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Meaningfully wraps up project and has good future directions.</em></p>
